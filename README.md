# py-pressure-logs

# Introduction

This project aims to solve business specific logic relating to log outputs from a series of pressure experiments. Experiments emit a linear progression of outputs, which should be grouped into experiments and validated against known bounds.

# Supported protocols

This project currently only supports documents of the `Sunscreen` and `Sunshine` Protocols

# Running locally

## Prerequisites

To run this project you will need Python v3.12.7 installed. If you do not have this already follow these instructions...
